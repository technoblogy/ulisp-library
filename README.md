ATtiny10Core
============

For programming the ATtiny10/9/5/4. For more information see http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1YQY.


This is a boards.txt file that adds options to the Arduino IDE's Board menu for programming the ATtiny10/9/5/4. It doesn't include an Arduino core, so there is no support for Arduino functions pinMode(), millis(), etc.

### Supported IDE versions

ATtiny10Core should work with all versions of the official IDE (from arduino.cc) from version 1.6.3 onwards. Version 1.8.3 is recommended.

### Installation

Download the .zip, extract it, and place it in the **hardware** folder inside the **Arduino** folder in your **Documents** folder. If there is no **hardware** folder, create it first.

### Supported chip variants:

* ATtiny10
* ATtiny9
* ATtiny5
* ATtiny4
